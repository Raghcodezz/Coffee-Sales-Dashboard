# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
### Introduction:
A dynamic interactive Excel Dashboard build to explore the coffee sales across various countries focussing on roast types, customer behavior, size based preferences and seasonal changes.

### Business Problem:
The coffee company needed a clear understanding of their sales across different roast types, packaging sizes, and regions not only to improve their profits but also identify the loss making regions and months in the year. But decision-makers lacked a simple visual tool to track performance over time and spot top customers and markets.

### Goal of the Dashboard:
The goal of the Dashboard is to provide the clear and interactive picture of the coffee sales including the metrics such as roast type, size, customer behavior and seasons and also helping the company identify the loss making regions and months in a year.

### Visuals in this dashboard:

1. Line chart:
   This chart gives us an idea of Total sales over time of each coffee type (Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Excelsa). It also helps us identify the peaks and dips in the 
   sales periods and also gives us a idea whether it is overall growth or decline.

2. Bar charts:
   
   One of the bar charts used in this dashboard provide us with the sales by country to know how the countries are performing in the coffee sales and to also know
   high and low performing country.
   
   Another bar chart is to identify the top 5 customers who spent the most on the coffee.

4. Slicers:
   Allows the user to interact with the dashboard by selecting specific roast types, customers with loyalty card or not, size, or the time periods.

### Insights Derived:
1. The coffee sales are high in winter season and sales were very low in the summer months.
2. The coffee sales in United Kingdom and Ireland were the lowest with United Kingdown being the lowest.
3. Most of the people prefer the light roast coffee as we can see steady consistency of this roast type in the line graph.
4. United States record high sales so instead of US we should focus more on other regions.
5. The most liked coffee type is Excelsa and the least selling coffee type was Arabica.
6. 50% of customers own a loyalty card 50% dont own a loyalty card.
